### Hi there 👋

<!--
**pnerkar2/pnerkar2** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am currently doing my masters majoring in Business Analytics from Gies College of Business. 

“What” and “Why” are two of my favorite questions. This preference is not due to their widespread use, but rather to the assistance these questions provide in making outstanding decisions.

Answering these questions has helped me leverage data to provide holistic solutions to Fortune 500 companies and drive their overall business impact. Furthermore, I have facilitated growth and development within companies and organizations through skillful communication and being abreast with current business trends.

I am constantly on a journey to make an impact on this world of data through insights, efficiency and innovation. Additionally, through experience, constant hard work and optimism, not just in my mind but in my behavior, I am on my way to earn leadership and assist my team to make an even bigger impact.

To take a break from analyzing data, I explore new places with new people to keep myself in practice.
